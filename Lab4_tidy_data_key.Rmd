knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Delivery:

1.Answer 8 questions in a word document. 

2.You should also submit a .csv file. 

3.You have 10 bonus points at the end of this lab. 

### To start: 

1. Create a new subfolder called "output" under lab4. 
2. Create a new project under lab4. 
3. Go to File---New file---R script. Name it as Lab4_.r. Save this script under Lab4 folder. 
4. Download the dataset from COMPASS called "air_raw_upload.csv" and save it under the "data" subfolder.  
 

Dataset information:

We will clean up the data downloaded from NSW Planning Industry & Environment website (https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/air-quality/search-for-and-download-air-quality-data). The meteorological variables was measured hourly in three stations: 1) WALLSEND; 2) NEWCASTLE; 3) BERESFIELD. 
The measured 5 types of meteorological variables are: 1) Wind speed; 2) Wind direction; 3) Air temperature; 4) Relative humidity; 5) Global solar radiation. 

Ideally, the tidy dataset should look like:

## Steps:

### 1. Import the dataset.
Execute the code below to load the dataset. Ignore the warning messages.    
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
air<- read_csv("data/air_raw_upload.csv")
```
Examine the dataset called Air_quality_raw and answer the quesions below. 

### Question 1: (5 points)
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?

Answer:  1440 rows and 17 columns

### Question 2: (5 points)
Is this dataset tidy or messy? Why?

Answer: Messy. The station and variables are mixed up, and the column names are not a certain attribute, they are certain values. 

                

### Hint: 
Let me provide you some initial thoughts here. The first few steps: `pivot_longer` (make your table longer. Organize multiple columns into one pair of columns) --separate (split the column contains multiple values).  

### 2. Turn wide table into a long one. Name the output as air_v1. 
First of all, you need to use `pivot_longer` to stack columns 3-17 together into two new columns. 


1. For the first new column: name it "mix"  to store the column names such as "WALLSEND WDR". 
2. For second new column: name it "measured_value" to store the corresponding value in that cell. 
3. Note you should exclude NAs.
4. You do not need to stack these columns: Date, Time. 

Please complete your code in R and answer the questions.

### Question 3:(5 points)
How many rows and columns does air_v1 have? 
```{r eval=FALSE}
air_v1 <- pivot_longer(air,cols=(-c("Date","Time")),
        names_to="mix",values_to="measured_value")
```


### 3. Separate the column called mix.
Note under air_v1, there is a column called mix. This column merges two types of information: 1) station name; 2) meteorological variable. These two parts are separated by space. 

Let's use `separate` function to split these strings into two new columns. 


1. Note you should set `sep` properly.
3. The old column to be separated is called "mix". 
4. For the two new columns, name them: "Station" and  "Meteorological variable". 

Complete the code in your script window. Assign the new data as air_v2.



We are almost there.



### Question 4:(5 points)
Examine air_v2. Why is this dataset a messy data? 
```{r eval=F}
air_v2 <- separate(air_v1, sep=" ",mix, c("Station","Meteorological variable"))
```
Answer: Yes it is still messy. The meteorological variables should have their own columns. 

### Question 5: (10 points)
Based on your answer above, select one of the following functins `separate`, `unite`, `pivot_longer` to make air_v2 clean. Name the output as air_v3. 
```{r eval=F}
air_v3 <- pivot_wider(air_v2,names_from="Meteorological variable",  
    values_from="measured_value")
```

### Question 6: (5 points)
After you execute the function you choose above, How many rows and columns do you have for this clean dataset (air_v3)? 
Answer: 4320 rows and 8 columns. 





### Question 7:(10 points)

Among the three stations, which one has the highest average temperature? 

Hint: Once your dataset is clean, let's use tapply to calculate the average by 3 stations. You need to exclude the NAs. 

Note you need to provide both your `tapply` code and answers for question 7. 
```{r eval=F}
tapply(air_v3$TEMP,air_v3$Station,mean, na.rm=T)
```
Answer: BERESFIELD: 24.22

### 4. Export and submit your assignment. 

Let's export this air_v3 as a .csv file on your local device. 
 Name your file as yourname_lab4.csv.

If the error message says

![ ](images/error.jpg) 

Make sure you have a subfolder called "output". Then execute the code below.


```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(air_v3,"output/Fang_lab4.csv")
```



### Question 8:(5 points)
Submit this .csv file into COMPASS. 



# This is the end of Lab 4. 

### Bonus: (10 points)

1) Examine the output called air_v3. Why it still contains NAs? (5 points)
Answer: Yes it contains NAs.

2) Try to use `drop_na` function to exclude all the NAs in air_v3. Name the output air_v4. Export air_v4 as a csv and turn it in compass (5 points).    

Hint: you can use `?drop_na` to know more about this function. 

```{r eval=F}
air_v4 <- drop_na(air_v3)
write_csv(air_v4,"output/air_v4.csv")
```
Answer: the drop_na function will exclude entire row if any NA appears
